Welcome to DBGSOM's documentation!
==================================

DBGSOM an implementation of the directed batch growing self organizing map. SOMs are a type of artificial neural network. They learn prototypes in an high dimensional input space (similar ro kmeans), but also maintain a topological ordering in an lower dimensional output space. If the output space is two dimensional, the SOM can be used to generate 2D-visualizations.
